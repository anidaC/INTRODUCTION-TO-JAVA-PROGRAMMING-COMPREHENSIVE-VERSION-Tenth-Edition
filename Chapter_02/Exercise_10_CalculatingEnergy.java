/*
 * (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy
 * needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your
 * program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and
 * the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the
 * energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature – initialTemperature) * 4184 where M is
 * the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and
 * energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run: 
 * Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5 
 * Enter the initial temperature: 3.5 
 * Enter the final temperature: 10.5 
 * The energy needed is 1625484.0
